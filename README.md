# 🌱 Krishi Sarthi: Smart Soil Health Monitoring System  
Krishi Sarthi is a comprehensive IoT solution designed to maximize crop production by monitoring soil health. Powered by the ESP8266 and supported by an intuitive MIT App Inventor application, this project focuses on real-time analysis of crucial soil micronutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). The data is securely transmitted to the cloud for continuous monitoring and actionable insights.

# 🚀 Features  
Soil Micronutrient Monitoring: Keep track of essential soil nutrients—N, P, K—for optimal crop health.  
**Cloud Integration:** Real-time data is stored and analyzed in the cloud, providing accessible insights anytime, anywhere.  
**ESP8266 Powered:** Utilizes the powerful and reliable ESP8266 microcontroller for efficient data processing and transmission.  
**Mobile App Support:** An easy-to-use MIT App Inventor app that allows users to monitor soil health directly from their smartphones.  

# 🛠️ Hardware Requirements  
ESP8266 Microcontroller  
Soil Nutrient Sensors (N, P, K)  
Power Supply  
Connectivity Modules (for cloud communication)  

# 📱 Application  
The mobile app, developed using MIT App Inventor, is your gateway to monitoring and managing your soil health data. The app includes:  

*Dashboard:* View real-time data on soil nutrients.  
**Alerts:** Get notified if any soil parameters are out of the desired range.  
**Control:** Manually control relays or other connected devices based on soil data.  

# ☁️ Cloud Service
Krishi Sarthi integrates with cloud platforms to ensure that your soil health data is safely stored, easily accessible, and effectively analyzed for better decision-making in agriculture.

# 💡 How It Works
**Data Collection:** The ESP8266 collects data from soil nutrient sensors.  
**Data Transmission:** The collected data is sent to the cloud for storage and analysis.  
**User Interaction:** The mobile app retrieves data from the cloud, providing real-time updates and alerts to the user.  
**Action:** Based on the data, users can make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other farming practices.
